                The Department of Computer Science and Information Systems at Birkbeck is one of the first computing
                departments established in the UK, celebrating our 60th anniversary in 2017. We provide a stimulating
                teaching and research environment for both part-time and full-time students, and a friendly, inclusive
                space for learning, working and collaborating.
